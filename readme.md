## About

(strongly suggest to click on link with ctrl because github doesn't allow target="_blank")

Project's live is here: [companiesdatadisplay.netlify.com](https://companiesdatadisplay.netlify.com/)

It takes a while for project to load beacuse of multiple fetches (which are essential due to totalIncome sort).
At the beggining I thought that I would do it in React. Then I was like "react would't really show my vanilla JavaScript skills" so.. It is done fully in pure JavaScript, the only tool I used was parcel bundler for local environment. Had fun doing it!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

1. [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - simply download and install it locally on your device.
2. npm - installed along with node.js
3. [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - module bundler contained in dev dependecies.

### Installing

1. open directory from your console
2. type parcel index.html
3. wait a while
3. your dev environment is up and running

## Deployment

I suggest using some serverless hosting like heroku or netlify.
