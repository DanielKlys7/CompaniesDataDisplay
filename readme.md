# Project Title

Companies data display

## About

Project's live is here: [companiesdatadisplay.netlify.com](https://companiesdatadisplay.netlify.com/)

It takes a while for project to load beacuse of multiple fetches (I guess).
At the beggining I thought that I would do it in React. Then I was like "react would't really show my vanilla JavaScript skills" so.. It is done fully in pure JavaScript, the only tool I used was parcel bundler for local environment. Had fun doing it!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

### Installing

1. open directory from your console
2. type parcel index.html
3. wait a while
3. your dev environment is up and running

## Deployment

I suggest using some serverless hosting like heroku or netlify.
